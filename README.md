YouTube Highlight Reel is a Google Chrome Extension that integrates directly onto the YouTube player and allows users to generate a highlight reel with the click of a button. When activated, the extension plays the most rewatched moments of the video and skips through the rest of the content, providing a streamlined experience for users to preview a YouTube video. This extension is primarily intended for educational and self-development videos, but can be utilized for all videos with rewatch statistics.
